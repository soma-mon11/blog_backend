(114, 'Science blog', 'Science is a rigorous, systematic endeavor that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.[1][2] Modern science is typically divided into three major branches:[3] natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study the physical world; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies;[4][5] and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which study formal systems, governed by axioms and rules.[6][7] There is disagreement whether the formal sciences are science disciplines,[8][9][10] because they do not rely on empirical evidence.[11][9] Applied sciences are disciplines that use scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as in engineering and medicine.[12][13][14]\r\n\r\nThe history of scientific discipline spans the majority of the historical record, with the earliest written records of identifiable predecessors to modern science dating to Bronze Age Egypt and Mesopotamia from around 3000 to 1200 BCE. Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped the Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes, while further advancements, including the introduction of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, were made during the Golden Age of India.[15]: 12 [16] [17][18] Scientific research deteriorated in these regions after the fall of the Western Roman Empire and Gupta empire during the early middle ages (400 to 1000 CE,) but was preserved and expanded upon in the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age[19] and later by the efforts of Byzantine Greek scholars who brought Greek manuscripts from the dying Byzantine Empire to Western Europe in the Renaissance.', 'science3.jpg', '2023-08-30', 'Science', 178),

I was assigned to IBM legal for a time in contracts, managed my own litigation for a couple of decades, and have been selected as an expert witness on several occasions. I also trained to be a lawyer before shifting to a very different career path.</p><p>I’ve learned that litigation isn’t anything like it is portrayed on TV. Both sides enter the courtroom with opposing views of reality, and the judge and/or jury listen to both sides before picking the most compelling argument as the winner. The winning side, which may have been in the wrong, feels vindicated, and the losing side generally feels cheated.</p><p>The outcome can have unintended and dire consequences for the losing side that can be far worse than had they left the entire thing alone in the first place or settled without a trial. Appeals generally cost around $40,000 and are rarely successful. The initial trial costs can range from over $10,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars before judgment, and the judgments can be very costly on top of that.</p><p>So, before suing someone, you need to make not only an honest assessment of whether you are likely to win but cover any potential unintended consequences of winning or losing. This is where I think the people suing the generative AI platforms are in trouble because they are not only unlikely to win but should they win, the result may cost them their careers.</p><p>Let me explain.</p>', 'cenima3.jpg', '2023-08-17', 'Cenima', 155),

(122, 'Cinema blog', '<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">been trying to analyse how different sort of people like Hazaaron. Some people fall in love with it and develop a sort of relationship with it. A lot of young people, students like it. The generation that lived through that period is grateful that someone made a film of that time and caught them as they were. The IAS wives association likes it!</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">I really get quite astounded. I have corporate heads say they love it. Sometimes, I imagine why would corporate heads like a film like this. Some people see it as a dark political film, some see it as a relationship film. I think it has doors through which you can walk in.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">... showed it in Patna, Bihar. There was a young minister sitting there, someone in the chief minister’s cabinet and 6-7 of his security guards; cops. I was sitting there and towards the end of the film, when Vikram gets battered by the cops, I thought the real cops would turn around and get after me but later on they came to me and said, “yeh bahut real tha”. Aise hi hota hai. Humko karna parta hai aisa.” (It was quite real. It’s always like this. We have to react like this at times.)</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Sometimes things do happen during the making of a film. The right story comes to you. The right actors come. In a sense it has revived my career in a very big way. Today who is Sudhir Mishra! They say it’s the Hazaaron director. It’s a little unfair on the other films. I start feeling sorry for Dharavi. I was quite fond of it. But, this is how it is. I thought of Hazaaron post Is Raat Ki Subah Nahin. It took about 5-6 years and quite a lot of rewrites. I first wrote it with Shiv Subramanium and then with Ruchi Narain.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In the beginning when I wrote it there was a 4th part as well. There was another transition. It was supposed to be in some future time in 2010 or 2020 but that was becoming a bit too much. .… Hazaaron is also a lot rewritten in the shooting. There’s no one method in film making. I tend to follow an impulse at the time of the shoot. That’s when the whole atmosphere and the whole unit come together. There’s an energy that happens. I follow that impulse and it takes you somewhere. If I made Hazaaron now it would be different and if I made it in 1996 it would have been different. It’s who you are at that time. It’s your entire thought process.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Also, some people have this strange relationship with Hazaaron. They come to me and say “Oh, I loved it but I don’t know if someone else will understand it.” There’s an assumption within audiences, which is very dangerous. In most of the reviews for Hazaaron, mostly all of them like it a lot and then they say, but it is strictly for so and so, strictly for the discerning. I find that a little presumptuous.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">It’s a film about these people but it’s not really me. My politics is different from Naxal politics, for example. My politics is different from Vikram as well. But there is a time, a place and a country when people veer towards an existing ideology. And the attraction of a lot of people towards the left in those days and even now till 1990s was and is that they thought this was not the best of all possible worlds. And therefore they had that idea of change. But, I don’t think they grasped the implications of that totally.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">I think the idea was that the few groups that were talking, were talking of dismantling what existed. I don’t think they thought too much about what would come after. And the problem with these ideologies has been that they have not envisioned the world that they want to bring. They merely want to dismantle what exists. Therefore revolutions fail. And all ideologies attempt to show you this pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Therefore, sometimes, an advertisement of a communist state and a fairness cream become similar. Every thing is offering you a heaven in the end, including religion.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In Hazaaron, Geeta is the person who understands that the world doesn’t change merely because you want it to and the change happens as a result of an interaction between a lot of things. Maybe women understand defeat easier and take loss better. Maybe. Vikram is the guy who is trying to be who he is not. Somewhere when his father rises up in him, he faces the kind of end he does. He is troubled. He’s always trying to be what he’s not. That’s the contradiction of Vikram. Through Geeta he keeps getting drawn back to something. Otherwise, he’s quite successful in what he’s done.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Lot of people see Vikram and Siddharth as different types of people. Actually they are three people of around the same kind. They are all aspects of our selves. Vikram is not really a son of a bitch. Though this is a non judgmental film, being non judgmental with these characters is not something that you consciously do, it’s who you are. It comes from a viewpoint.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In Dharavi, Rajkaran Yadav is a taxi driver, who in one moment, in his ambition betrays his friends. He gets carried away with power. His wife walks out on him. Is his wife right or is he right. We are not judging him.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">And this is one of the problems that audiences and even cinematic literate audiences have with my films. Even in the art film formula of the 70s there was the innocent posited against the evil oppressor. So, there was the Zamindar as oppressor. But it’s more complicated than that in our world now. The simple Chaplinesque, innocent is not possible any more either. We all carry the world in our heads and we are all corrupted ourselves.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Some audiences are also like children wanting to root for somebody, like the Lagaan cricket team, for example. A lot of films hence, are variations attempted to be Lagaan. Lagaan does that most successfully. But, mostly in life, you don’t find that at all, so you try and find that in films. And that’s even how scriptwriting is taught. You find a character. You have to root for this guy.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Can anybody make a film about someone who is not so right, not so perfect, yet who is killed in a riot? But it was wrong, that he was killed in a riot. For example, there might be someone who is somewhat of a bastard. But you can’t kill him because someone you idolized died. Make a film like that and who do you root for? Then you’ll say, who is the hero! The adult thing in life is that as much as you disagree with somebody you can’t kill him. That’s a mature world.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Faiths may disagree with each other and all religions disagree with one another that’s why they are different. All this con that people say there is one God. If it was that easy, then why do you fight! Many religions are against each other. There is some element in them which is in opposition with the other. The maturity of the world has to be that you live with those differences.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">I am quite glad that Hazaaron worked at a level that it did even then. I don’t know if you can root for Vikram. Maybe you can, because he is in love. But Geeta is not in love with him and is in love with Siddharth who is a bit caught up with himself and the notion of what he wants to do. Geeta leaves her husband for no particular reason except for that she married wrong. There’s a lot of grey there. In all of them. But still at least a certain section of the audiences are becoming adult.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Actually nobody has ever written on Hazaaron in terms of Geeta. Maybe it’s a success of the writing or the way the actress played it or the combination of all these things that you don’t judge her. Here she is a girl who is in love with one person in the beginning of the film, making another guy hang around her and sort of using him a bit. And then walking out on all of them into a marriage and then coming back realizing it’s a wrong marriage. All this, while she keeps using this hanger-on, Vikram. And in the end when this guy really needs her, and he’s actually a vegetable, helpless, she’s giving him a shoulder and he doesn’t even know it.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Geeta is a complicated woman. There are very few women characters like that in Indian cinema. Critics are used to characters who shout from the rooftops and women who quote the entire mythology of the country in order to justify sleeping with someone.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In Hazaaron it passes fluidly. There’s a scene in the film where Vikram comes with a bottle of champagne when Geeta is back in Delhi. He says, “your husband Arun came to see me.” She asks, “So what did he say”. Vikram answers, “he asked if I was in love with his wife and I said yes I was in love with her”. And she laughs. She says, “Thanks Vikram, I was just going to get horribly sentimental.” Now that could be a bitch! She laughs! Then she comes out and says, “I am not going to live here”. She made him buy that flat!</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The scene in the end with Vikram is Geeta’s redemption where she has to look after him. Actually she made this guy do what he did and at this point she has to reconcile with the fact that she has to look after him. She never actually did anything for him in the whole film and she used him totally. And he’s still muttering, I love you.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">While making Hazaaron, I thought very few people make films about ‘us’. Usually films are about ‘them’. About that cab driver, that prostitute. This is a film about us and there is the failure of all those who were priviledged and were conscious of that fact and were a bit guilt ridden about it and wanted to somewhat change. They still carry vestiges of some of the ideas within them.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">But, then in Khoya Khoya Chand, my next film I step out of that territory totally. It’s the same film maker, though. Even if you go into other territories, it’s you. Here I try to make a film about ‘me’ more than anything. Of course you put a story in a time to deliberately distance yourself. You put it in the 50s and 60s which is a period of cinema I like. It’s a film about people who are in this medium and the difficulty of it all.</span></p>', 'cenima2.jpg', '2023-08-24', 'Cenima', 162),
(123, 'Cinema', 'Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.

(124, 'Cienema Blog', '<p><em>Blue Beetle</em>&nbsp;deserves better than a lacklustre release at the arse end of a dying franchise. This hugely likeable super romp will play to the dust balls. A minimalist promotional programme from Warner Bros. says it all.&nbsp;<em>Flash</em>&nbsp;bombed and word on the streets has it that audiences just don’t care anymore. All executive eyes are instead on next year’s James Gunn franchise reboot. Expect, maybe they should care about this little try hard. Forget the wider world for one moment and embrace&nbsp;<em>Blue Beetle</em>&nbsp;as the most heartfelt, charming and unselfconsciously funny film the DCEU has produced in…well, perhaps ever. Sure, the bar’s low but don’t let that put you off either.</p><p>On one level,&nbsp;<em>Blue Beetle</em>&nbsp;answers the increasing convolutions of recent hero offerings – from DC and Marvel alike – via a reversion to convention. Certainly, a script by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer plums the class origins story mould. There’s a wide-eyed youth, a misadventure with alien technology, profiteering baddie, final battle and attractive beau, ready and waiting to be whisked off their feet. It’s all very 2008, right down to the titular Beetle’s shiny suit and silky smooth AI PA, here voiced by pop star Becky G. There’s a dash of Venom’s buddy comedy here but&nbsp;<em>Iron Man</em>&nbsp;and Spidey that provide the clearest line of comparison. Where&nbsp;<em>Blue Beetle</em>&nbsp;stands apart, however, is a setting shift from the brightly lit big city to the poorer suburbs in its shadow. That’s one half of the ace card here.</p><p>The other half belongs to a rather more left field narrative twist. As played by&nbsp;<em>Cobra Kai</em>’s Xolo Maridueña, Blue Beetle – aka Jamie Reyes – is a hero who brings his family along for the ride. Not some&nbsp;<em>Shazam</em>&nbsp;bros. gang either. We’re talking mum, dad, uncle, sister and grandma too. She’s the most fierce – one time revolutionary – but Belissa Escobedo’s younger sis gives it good. Much is made of the family is king schtick that’s been the Fast and Furious mantra for more than a decade – ‘the love that I have for my family, that’s what makes me strong’ – but it’s the gawky embarrassment they bring to the table that really gives&nbsp;<em>Blue Beetle</em>&nbsp;it’s fuzzy edge.</p><p>Particularly pleasing is the film’s delightful cultural specificity. Dialogue slips between English and Spanish at a rat-a-tat pace, encapsulating a painstakingly honest family dynamic. While the entourage mostly offer comic relief, there is soul here too, well captured in a string of scenes that prove equally hilarious and moving. Far and away,&nbsp;<em>Blue Beetle</em>’s most memorable and affecting scene is neither action set piece nor dramatic denouement but the poignant delivery of a single line to a wounded unit late in a very long day.</p>', 'cenima2.jpg', '2023-09-05', 'Cenima', 187),

There’s no one method in film making. I tend to follow an impulse at the time of the shoot. That’s when the whole atmosphere and the whole unit come together. There’s an energy that happens. I follow that impulse and it takes you somewhere. If I made Hazaaron now it would be different and if I made it in 1996 it would have been different. It’s who you are at that time. It’s your entire thought process.\r\n\r\nAlso, some people have this strange relationship with Hazaaron. They come to me and say “Oh, I loved it but I don’t know if someone else will understand it.” There’s an assumption within audiences, which is very dangerous. In most of the reviews for Hazaaron, mostly all of them like it a lot and then they say, but it is strictly for so and so, strictly for the discerning. I find that a little presumptuous.\r\n\r\nIt’s a film about these people but it’s not really me. My politics is different from Naxal politics, for example. My politics is different from Vikram as well. But there is a time, a place and a country when people veer towards an existing ideology. And the attraction of a lot of people towards the left in those days and even now till 1990s was and is that they thought this was not the best of all possible worlds. And therefore they had that idea of change. But, I don’t think they grasped the implications of that totally.\r\n\r\nI think the idea was that the few groups that were talking, were talking of dismantling what existed. I don’t think they thought too much about what would come after. And the problem with these ideologies has been that they have not envisioned the world that they want to bring. They merely want to dismantle what exists. Therefore revolutions fail. And all ideologies attempt to show you this pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Therefore, sometimes, an advertisement of a communist state and a fairness cream become similar.

(130, 'Art Blog', '<p>To understand Frankenthaler, we must first get to know the art movement, Abstract Expressionism which arose in New York in the 1940s, after World War II. Influenced by the Surrealist idea that art should come from the unconscious mind, the Abstract Expressionists aimed to make art that was a pure expression of emotion. Amongst the style, are two broad groupings: action painters, like Jackson Pollock, who created spontaneous and large mark makings, and colour field painters like Mark Rothko, painting flat planes of colour.</p><p>Helen Frankenthaler sits in the midst of this. Morris Louis once described her as “a bridge between Pollock and what was possible”, meaning that she was influenced by his expressive mark makings, but imbued it with a fresh outlook. Here, he is referring to her soak-stain technique which she invented in 1952. This is the process of pouring turpentine thinned oil paint from coffee cans onto an unprimed canvas on the floor. This meant that the thinned oil paint would permeate the canvas, creating pools of bright colours, allowing the colours to bleed into, and through each other.</p>', 'art2.jpg', '2023-09-08', 'Art', 195),
(131, 'Cenima Blog', '<p><em>Blue Beetle</em>&nbsp;deserves better than a lacklustre release at the arse end of a dying franchise. This hugely likeable super romp will play to the dust balls. A minimalist promotional programme from Warner Bros. says it all.&nbsp;<em>Flash</em>&nbsp;bombed and word on the streets has it that audiences just don’t care anymore. All executive eyes are instead on next year’s James Gunn franchise reboot. Expect, maybe they should care about this little try hard. Forget the wider world for one moment and embrace&nbsp;<em>Blue Beetle</em>&nbsp;as the most heartfelt, charming and unselfconsciously funny film the DCEU has produced in…well, perhaps ever. Sure, the bar’s low but don’t let that put you off either.</p><p>On one level,&nbsp;<em>Blue Beetle</em>&nbsp;answers the increasing convolutions of recent hero offerings – from DC and Marvel alike – via a reversion to convention. Certainly, a script by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer plums the class origins story mould. There’s a wide-eyed youth, a misadventure with alien technology, profiteering baddie, final battle and attractive beau, ready and waiting to be whisked off their feet. It’s all very 2008, right down to the titular Beetle’s shiny suit and silky smooth AI PA, here voiced by pop star Becky G. There’s a dash of Venom’s buddy comedy here but&nbsp;<em>Iron Man</em>&nbsp;and Spidey that provide the clearest line of comparison. Where&nbsp;<em>Blue Beetle</em>&nbsp;stands apart, however, is a setting shift from the brightly lit big city to the poorer suburbs in its shadow. That’s one half of the ace card here.</p><p>The other half belongs to a rather more left field narrative twist. As played by&nbsp;<em>Cobra Kai</em>’s Xolo Maridueña, Blue Beetle – aka Jamie Reyes – is a hero who brings his family along for the ride. Not some&nbsp;<em>Shazam</em>&nbsp;bros. gang either. We’re talking mum, dad, uncle, sister and grandma too. She’s the most fierce – one time revolutionary – but Belissa Escobedo’s younger sis gives it good. Much is made of the family is king schtick that’s been the Fast and Furious mantra for more than a decade – ‘the love that I have for my family, that’s what makes me strong’ – but it’s the gawky embarrassment they bring to the table that really gives&nbsp;<em>Blue Beetle</em>&nbsp;it’s fuzzy edge.</p><p>Particularly pleasing is the film’s delightful cultural specificity. Dialogue slips between English and Spanish at a rat-a-tat pace, encapsulating a painstakingly honest family dynamic. While the entourage mostly offer comic relief, there is soul here too, well captured in a string of scenes that prove equally hilarious and moving. Far and away,&nbsp;<em>Blue Beetle</em>’s most memorable and affecting scene is neither action set piece nor dramatic denouement but the poignant delivery of a single line to a wounded unit late in a very long day.Such is not to say that&nbsp;<em>Blue Beetle</em>&nbsp;lacks pizzazz and heft. Jamie’s first transformation alone prompts a thrilling sequence of fizzing spectacle and dramatic wallop. It occurs as Jaime makes contact with ‘the Scarab,’ an ancient alien artefact stolen from ruthless CEO Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) by her wealthy heiress niece Jenny (Bruna Marquezine). While Victoria ploys to utilise the Scarab’s powers to bolster a super-powered army, the thing itself has other ideas. If Khaji-Da hasn’t the zingers in its arsenal that helped make Venom a hit, the interplay endears, reaping a heartfelt arc and, yes, more than it’s fair share of laugh out loud gags. Throw in some&nbsp;<em>Sonic</em>-neon lighting and&nbsp;<em>Shazam</em>-esque fish out of water fun and you’re left with a hero that’s a treat to watch and well worth rooting for.</p><p>While there’s no question that the narrative he powers through lacks memorability – the journey is a check box of secret lairs, car chases and a final showdown – there is something to be said for the film’s morality. The Reyes family live in the shadow of imperialist wealth – ‘we used to own the other side of the tracks&nbsp;</p>', 'cenima2.jpg', '2023-09-08', 'cinema', 195),

The attraction boasts a cult of kookiness, ripe and ready for the picking. There are characters decades in the fine tuning and ingenious animatronic effects primed for direct transfer to cinematic fun times. Rob Minkoff’s 2003 effort plumbed heavy on undead slapstick, casting Eddie Murphy for rent-a-mouth zane. It’s a far more fondly remembered nostalgia dump than any film with barbershop busts has any right to be but did a least enjoy a certain exuberant energy. Two decades on, Justin Simien’s reboot lands dead on arrival. The only real scare this time is a realisation that this incompetent mess comes from the man behind&nbsp;<em>Dear White People</em>.</p><p>More depressingly, the new&nbsp;<em>Haunted Mansion</em>&nbsp;was originally born to the mind of Guillermo del Toro. Oh, what might have been. Ostensibly, the bare bones of Del Toro’s initial conceit remain here, swaddled in more palatable writing from one time Ghostbusters reviver Katie Dippold. A New Orleans setting pitches the titular mansion as the new buy of recently-singled mum Gabbie (Rosario Dawson) and her uptight young son Travis (Chase W. Dillon). Having upped sticks from New York, the duo ploy to turn Gracey Manor into a bed and breakfast, following a spot of DIY and TLC. Little do they realise the RIP set up they’re about to enter. Inert execution squanders the film’s ghoulish reveal, hashing a sequence with obvious potential for amusement. Christopher Landon’s We Have a Ghost did it far better earlier in the year – and he only had the one spook to play with.</p><p>Alongside this intro, a separate pre-titles sting nudges LaKeith Stanfield’s astrophysicist Ben towards the film’s emotional core. In quick succession, Ben’s burgeoning romance with paranormal tour guide Alyssa (Charity Jordan) segues to present day woe. Alyssa has died and Ben has turned to drink, wasting his days in a wasted haze. Likely driven by an urge to find definitive proof as to whether he will ever see his late wife again, Ben now leads Alyssa’s tour. By the time we join him, ghosts are a taboo topic.</p>', 'art1.jpg', '2023-09-08', 'Art', 196),
